        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second year college student at the University of California Riverside. I am currently undeclared in the College of Humanities and Social Sciences (CHASS). While trying to decide upon my major, I have taken to finding subjects that spark my interest. I’ve always enjoyed cooking and baking, volunteering for my community, and doing activities that build socialization and communication skills. I’ve taken part in many organizations to help me build experience such as Link Crew, National Honors Society, Scholars programs, and Black Student Union. From these clubs I have learned skills such as organization, communication, leadership, collaboration, fast adaptation, critical thinking, and time management. All of which will help me in building my career.
<br><br>

        I have many strong suits when it comes to customer relations. Some of which include, a calm demeanor, patience, understanding and compromising, clear communication, and a positive attitude. This is important in the food industry because it can increase sales, ratings, and a customer's experience which ensures that they will be more likely to return and recommend your services to others. It is also important in situations where there is an unhappy customer. These skills allow you to properly handle the circumstances by preventing hostile or heated environments that could have otherwise been avoided. By using a certain language that lets the customer know you're empathetic, sorry, and willing to make things right, it lets them know you’re understanding and therefore makes them less likely to leave a bad review and potentially return for your service. 
<br><br>

        When it comes to the food service industry, I am very well trained in this line of work. At first, cooking was just a hobby of mine that I had been practicing for about 2 years. Then, starting in 2022, I received my credentials for the State of California Food Handlers License. These credentials taught me how to properly store food, the different types of hazards food can be exposed to and how to prevent it, how to properly care for the environments surrounding and containing food products, etc.  By April of that same year, I became employed at El Pollo Loco as a cashier. I was introduced to the POS operating system, gained first-hand experience dealing with angry customers, taught how to thoroughly clean the store,  and was exposed to working in a fast paced-environment. After about 5 months of employment here, I then found work at another location, Lothian Dining at the University of California Riverside. I was employed here for about a year and during this time I worked my way up from a general dining assistant to student-lead. With this promotion I went from assisting the cooks and cleaning the inside and outside dining areas to delegating tasks, closing and opening up the restaurant, learning how to operate every system in the building, and overseeing every station. In gaining all this experience, I took back to El Pollo Loco where I can take all that I have learned and apply it to this store in order to become a manager.
